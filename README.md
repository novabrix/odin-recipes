<!-- Hello! This is a project I am completing for the Odin Project (and for myself!)
The skills I will demonstrate here are, but not limited to:
-Knowledge of Linux directories
-Proper usage of the Linux/VScode terminal
-creating an HTML boilerplate
-adding links and images for extra flair (even though that's CSS's thing)
-knowing how to write paragraphs and add details to them
-following through on the numerous git commands I have learned

...and that's about it! Until next time...>
